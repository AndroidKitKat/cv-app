# cv-app
ND CV Class app to recognize buildings. 

## build apps

### for ios

```
cd cvApp
cordova build ios
open -a Xcode platforms/ios
```

Then deploy the app for iOS like you normally would using Xcode

### for android

```
cd cvApp
cordova build android
```

It will look like it failed, but that's fine. 

Open Android Studio and go to 

File > Open > Path/to/cvApp/platforms/android

Then deploy the app for Android like you normally would using Android Studio
